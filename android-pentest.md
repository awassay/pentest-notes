## Reversing APKs
- Use apktool to decompile the APK
```sh
apktool -d app.apk
```
- We can repack APKs using apktool b and the resulting .apk will be written to the ./dist folder. But we need to sign it!
```sh
cd ./app.apk/
apktool b
```
- To sign the APK, we need to create a keystore which will contain our signing key. To create a testing.keystore with a key named test_key, use keytool
```sh
keytool -genkey -v -keystore testing.keystore -alias test_key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```
- To sign an APK we use jarsigner
```sh
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore testing.keystore ./dist/app.apk test_key
# On newer Android versions SHA1 signatures still get rejected. In that case simply use the default algorithms
jarsigner -verbose -keystore testing.keystore app.apk test_key
```
- Errors when signing apks:
  - INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES: There is still something wrong with the signature. &rarr; Maybe you tried to install an unsigned apk or the chosen algorithm (eg. SHA1) gets rejected.
  - INSTALL_FAILED_INVALID_APK: Failed to extract native libraries &rarr; This error occurs with some versions of apktool if the app contains native-libraries. To fix it, edit the AndroidManifest.xml so that extractNativeLibs is set to true. Afterwards you need to repackage and re-sign your APK.
  - INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE: Package io.hextree.reversingexample signatures do not match previously installed version; ignoring! &rarr; You will get this message if a version of the app signed with a different key is installed on the device. The simple solution is to delete the existing app.
  - Failed parse during installPackageLI: Targeting R+ (version 30 and above) requires the resources.arsc of installed APKs to be stored uncompressed and aligned on a 4-byte boundary.
    - This happens on newer apps, try this alternative method using zipalign and apksigner coming with the specific version build tools:
      ```sh
      apktool b
      C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\build-tools\34.0.0\zipalign -p -f -v 4 ./dist/<apktool_build>.apk aligned.apk
      C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\build-tools\34.0.0\apksigner sign --ks ./testing.keystore ./aligned.apk
      ```
## Network Interception
1. **Installing System Certificate: (Android 9+) (Rooted Device Needed)** Due to the default network security config rules, most apps only trust "system" certificates. The default configuration for apps targeting **Android 9 (API level 28) and higher** is as follows:
  ```
  <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
      <trust-anchors>
          <certificates src="system" />
      </trust-anchors>
  </base-config>
  ```
  - Install the proxy certificate as a regular user certificate
  - Ensure you are root (adb root), and execute the following commands in adb shell:
    ```sh
    # Backup the existing system certificates to the user certs folder
    cp /system/etc/security/cacerts/* /data/misc/user/0/cacerts-added/
    
    # Create the in-memory mount on top of the system certs folder
    mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts
    
    # copy all system certs and our user cert into the tmpfs system certs folder
    cp /data/misc/user/0/cacerts-added/* /system/etc/security/cacerts/
    
    # Fix any permissions & selinux context labels
    chown root:root /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
    chmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
    chcon u:object_r:system_file:s0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
    ```
    - **Note:** There have been significant changes in **Android 14** in the way how the system certificates are handled. For Android 14, follow this blog [New ways to inject system CA certificates in Android 14](https://httptoolkit.com/blog/android-14-install-system-ca-certificate/)
